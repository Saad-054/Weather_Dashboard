## Description
This repository houses a captivating and interactive Code Quiz web application, designed for users to test their coding knowledge. The quiz presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions and starts a timer upon clicking the "Start" button. As users answer each question, they are immediately presented with another question. However, incorrect answers lead to time deductions, adding an element of urgency and challenge to the quiz. The game concludes either when the timer reaches zero or when all questions have been answered.

To develop this application, three JavaScript files played essential roles. The index.html file provided the basic structure of the quiz, defining question elements, buttons, and score displays. The style.css file added visually appealing and user-friendly styling, ensuring a delightful user experience. The real magic, however, was embedded within the logic.js file. This JavaScript code orchestrated the entire quiz, handling the logic behind the timer, question display, answer validation, scoring, and the end-game event.

As a junior web developer, building this Code Quiz was a valuable learning experience. I sharpened my JavaScript skills and gained insights into DOM manipulation, event handling, and data management. The application introduced me to handling dynamic data using arrays and objects, as well as using local storage to save user data. This project strengthened my grasp of core JavaScript concepts and equipped me with problem-solving skills applicable to future web development endeavors. As I continue my journey, the lessons learned from this quiz application will undoubtedly prove valuable in creating more engaging and interactive web experiences for users.
